# Case study of Cairo/Egypt [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) xml file.

-Cairo is the capital of Egypt (my country).
-The uncompressed map xml-osm file is about 120 mb downloaed from [mapzen openstreetmap extractions](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/cairo_egypt/)
-Most of the entries are from Cairo, but still there is a few from the two cities [ Banha,Giza) which are close to cairo.
-Knowing the data from OpenStreetMap  means that no one review the submit which causes lots of messy things.
-We will get to some of these messy data any try to clean them as much as we can.
The xml data consists of 3 major tags ( [node](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Node), [way](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Way), [relation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation) ),click on them for more information and check the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page),
And 3 children tags [ (tag)[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags] - member(parent=relation) - nd(parent=way) ].
- what I'm concerned about in the cleaning proces is child tag "tag" which is in the form [key:value].
